# NetBox AV Plugin

Netbox Plugin for Audio Video interfaces


* Free software: GPL-3.0-only
* Documentation: https://hunordori.github.io/netbox-av-plugin/


## Disclosure

I am not a Django developer. This project encouraged me to learn more about the framework.

## The Idea

[Netbox](https://netboxlabs.com/) handles devices, network interfaces and cables well. Me and my collegues work with a lot of video equipment which uses SDI and other video interfaces. Our idea is to document broadcast audio and video equipment racks in Netbox.

## Features

The features the plugin provides should be listed here.

## Compatibility

| NetBox Version | Plugin Version |
|----------------|----------------|
|     4.0        |      0.1.0     |

## Installing

For adding to a NetBox Docker setup see
[the general instructions for using netbox-docker with plugins](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox-docker/wiki/Using-Netbox-Plugins).

While this is still in development and not yet on pypi you can install with pip:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/hunordori/netbox-av-plugin
```

or by adding to your `local_requirements.txt` or `plugin_requirements.txt` (netbox-docker):

```bash
git+https://github.com/hunordori/netbox-av-plugin
```

Enable the plugin in `/opt/netbox/netbox/netbox/configuration.py`,
 or if you use netbox-docker, your `/configuration/plugins.py` file :

```python
PLUGINS = [
    'netbox-av-plugin'
]

PLUGINS_CONFIG = {
    "netbox-av-plugin": {},
}
```
